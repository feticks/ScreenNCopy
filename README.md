# ScreenNCopy

ScreenNCopy allows for easy accurate copy and pasting of text from a screenshot.
The main purpose of this was to counter writing text from a Teams call and therefore minimising the time it will take...

ScreenNCopy lets you take a screenshot of a specific location on your screen which is converted to gray scale to help improve the OCR (optical character recognition) clarity, OCR is used to "convert" the image to a string which is split up to words and then (if checked/enabled) uses a basic auto-correct to increase accuracy.
